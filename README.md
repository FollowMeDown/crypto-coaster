# Crypto Coaster 

A quick little static web page that shows the famous Bitcoin mascot on his coaster ride of the price fluctuations.

Using sockets from CryptoCompare (https://www.cryptocompare.com/) and simple CSS rotation depending on the % change.

I like to think this project is simple - yet effective!
