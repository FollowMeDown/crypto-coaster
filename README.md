# Crypto Coaster 
![CryptoCoaster](https://i.imgur.com/lVxWVeD.png)

A quick little static web page that shows a number of cryptocurrency mascots on their coaster ride of crazy price fluctuations.

Using sockets from CryptoCompare (https://www.cryptocompare.com/) and simple CSS rotation depending on the % change.

I like to think this project is simple - yet effective!

## Development
1. `npm install`
2. `webpack` or `webpack -w` to have webpack listen for changes in files. You will still have to refresh the webpage though.
